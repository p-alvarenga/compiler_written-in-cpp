	[[ UPDATE ]] The operator identificator is working properly.

	Todo:  
		- [ ] Write the numerical identifier; (123 & 1.23)
		- [ ] Write CompileError class and it's derivatives (LexerError, ParserError...);

	[[ SOLVED ]] [!] PROBLEM: Something is really strange in the system of recognizing operators. It follows the same structure of the keywords/id system. So the problem must be simple, solve it pls :)

	[!] PROBLEM: the Lexer::tokenize() function is identifing token by itself and not asking for identifyToken()
	[*] NOTE   : Write CompileError and its derivatives (LexerError, ParserError etc.) [with ::throw()]


12-08-2025:

	Todo.:
		1. [ ] Write Lexer::peek(size_t offset) function;
		2. [ ] Continue writting the tokenize function, processing OperatorChar(c); 

	Notes: 	
		1. Explore more the use of constexpr keyword
		2. optimize the Lexer::IdentifyToken() on IdentifierStart case;


09-08-2025: 

	Todo: 
		- [x] Optimize and simplify the Lexer::tokenize() function;
		- [x] Write the Lexer::identifyKeyword()  # doesn't exist anymore
		- [x] Write the Lexer::identifyToken() (maybe change the name too) # changed for Lexer::tokenize()
